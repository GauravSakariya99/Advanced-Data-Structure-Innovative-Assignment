# B+ Tree Advanced Data Structure Innovative Assignment
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Implemented using C++</p><br>
<h3>Order of B+ Tree</h3> 
<p>Order of m B+ Tree can have
Atmost m children 
Atleast ceil[m/2]  chirdren<br>
  Any node that has m children has m-1 elements.
</p>
<h3>Properties of B+ Tree</h3>
<p>All leaves are at the same level.<br>
The root has at least two children.<br>
All keys in node are in sorted order.
</p><br>
<p>Insertion of a Node in B-Tree happens only at Leaf Node.
All Leaves are connected sequentially.
Data only in leaf nodes
</p>
